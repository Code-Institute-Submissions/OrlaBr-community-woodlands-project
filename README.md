### A User-Centric Frontend Development Project 


***Introduction***
Project name is a <utility/tool/feature> that allows <insert_target_audience> to do <action/task_it_does>.
This was my first project developed as part of the *[Code Institute] 'Full Stack Developmer' Bootcamp*. I wanted to 
make a functional website, that focused primarily on getting peroples attention and getting them to. Why did you want 
to create it? To learn a particular technology? Was it a hackathon project? Was it for a non-profit organization? 
Is it an application created to memorize the material from workshops or and online course? It's worth mentioning here, 
without a doubt

***Prerequisites***
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed the latest version of <coding_language/dependency/requirement_1>
You have a <Windows/Linux/Mac> machine. State which OS is supported/which is not.
You have read <guide/link/documentation_related_to_project>.

***UX***
 - who this website is for
 - what it is that they want to achieve
 - how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

***User Stories***

User type: I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- wireframes
- mockups
- diagrams 
(Links or add pdf into project in an separate directory

***Features***
Different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence

 - Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement


***Technologies Used***
- Bootstrap 3 or 4
-HTML
-CSS
-JQuery

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

***Testing***
Go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

*Contact form:*
-Go to the "Contact Us" page
-Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
-Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
-Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
-In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

-You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

***Deployment/Launch***
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
How to run a project? Does a project has minimum hardware requirements?
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
