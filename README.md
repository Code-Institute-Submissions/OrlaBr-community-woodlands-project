The aim of this website is to create a modern visual presence online for a new community based project ‘Corca Dhuibhne Community Woodlands’. The goal is to create awareness of the overall project itself and to get actively people involved, in some way.

## Description
The website has a dual purpose. It was created for a new local community group to use, but it also deploys all my course learning to date with the Code Institute. The elements I used in creating this website, are all practical techniques I have been learning,  working through the User Centric Frontent Develment modules of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.
##UX
The main function of the website was to create a visual presence online for a local community group, ‘Corca Dhuibhne Community Woodlands’, so they can showcase their work to date, engage with the general public to become involved, and also promote activities and events they are running. 
*Strategy Plane*: The objective is to create a feel-good visually appealing custom website with calls to action to engage the public to become involved in the project as either active or passive participants. The overall impression of this woodlands website, is that of greenery, vitality, reflecting the goal of the community group, that is to create a community run woodland for everyones benefit. 
The predominant users of the site are general public, who maybe have heard of the project word of mouth or have heard about the project already through local media or social media sites. The initial impression is of greenery and vitality, to give the impression of a vibrant active community group, reflecting their goals to create a beautiful communal woodands.
Also, secondary yet vital users, are partnering organisations and funders. Developing a modern professional looking website, will in turn help with future funding applications.  
Peer research - I reserched a number of similar community projects and websites, and found the websites to be very plain and content heavy. So I decided to keep the content to a minimum and introduce more visually stunning pictures, to evoke more feeling and reaction to the idea of a community woodlands. Keeping the written content to a minimum also reduces the amout of time the website admin need to update the site, reflecting the importance of their time as volunteers who prefer to be outside. Updates can be added regularily to the all important newsletter, the blog and to social media sites. The responsibility to maintain the website and social media channels is met with reluctance  yet it is of vital importance to community groups looking for funding. Funding bodies, like to be visually represented. 
*Scope Plane*: Creation of a MVW, minimum viable website with mixed content that has the potential to grow. The need of the wesite is to provide vital imformation about the role and function of the community group. Important features are the contact form, access to a newsletter-sign up, and an active blog to showcase projects and activities. The blog also helps increase seo searchability. I decided on a simple scroll down website to reflect modern trends and designed the website using bootstrap mobile first’ theory.
*Structure*: A minimal website, with simple content yet visually stunning. The website needed to reflect the communigty groups focus, that is to develop and grow the group with predominant calls to action to contact the group, and sign up to the newsletter. The presence of the blog helps to engage the user at a personal level and to promote activites and events. 
*Skeleton Plane*: Top priority is awareness about the aims of the project, using visual imagry, evoking the charms of native woodlands, I decided to use large images with no overlaying text to appeal to the senses, and woo the user. The next priority is information on how to support and connect with the project, through information and a contact form, while thirdly finding out about whats going on in the project, throug a blog function. The colour schemes were very deliberate, using the same greens and purples that could be found in a few of the images. Eg moss and mushrooms, trees and bluebells. Rich imagry, strong emotions, and clear patterns, make this website stand out more than other local community websites. As I have prior experience with Canva, I decided to create my mock ups there. That way I could move from wireframe to visual quickly. I created a mobile mock up, and then a desktop version, and researched how to convert one to the other using bootstrap as the main framework. 
*Surface Plane*: Using Canva as a mock up tool, I was able to create a very accurate depiction of what the final website would look like, the colour schemes, placement, colours and fonts. I also decided to use font awesome icons, as these are now universally know. I also revised the text, to be included in the final web design. Although the mock-up isnt exactly the same as the final version of the website, I made small changes along the way, in order to create a more fluid website. Such as making the navigation stick, as I found in the desktop version, it took too long to scroll down and back up again. 
 
##Features
*Existing Features*
Sign Up Form - getting users to sign up to a newsletter was one of the top prioritys, so I decided to put it on the first page as a pop-up modal. It meant the user could imediately identify with where it is. 
Contact Us Form- The website goal is to try to drum up public support for the community group, and inviting people to support in a number of ways was very important. By using a generic contact form it was inviting the user to identify ways they could themselves help, rather than a simple call for money or action. This reflects the long term goals of the project, rather than a simply ‘gofund me’ attitude
Blog - Blogs are very undervalued elements in a website, and especially for a community group, can increase participation hugely. The blog was develop on a card system, with the visual element the biggest, to evoke more feeling and anticipation in the user.
*Features Left to Implement*
Development of the blog to include archives and a search function
Development of the footer to include a sponsor and partner section

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
##Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
Text - how to use it, down load, github depository, how to infogure, install.
